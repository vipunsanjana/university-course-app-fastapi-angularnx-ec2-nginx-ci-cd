## Overview

This repository contains a **fullstack application** designed to:

- Help Sri Lankan A/L students find university degree programs based on their Z-score, stream, and district (**FastAPI backend**).
- Provide a modern, scalable **Angular Nx frontend** for enterprise organization management.

Both backend and frontend are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer for production-ready deployment.

## üîß Setup & Deployment

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Configure your environment secrets**  
   - Add your backend `.env` variables securely in GitHub Secrets (e.g., Google Sheets credentials)  
   - Add your Docker Hub credentials as secrets for CI/CD login

3. **Build & Push Docker Images** (via GitHub Actions)  
   The workflow builds backend, frontend, and custom NGINX images, then pushes to Docker Hub.

4. **Deploy to your EC2 Self-hosted Runner**  
   - Pull the latest Docker images  
   - Stop old containers  
   - Run backend replicas and frontend container  
   - Run custom NGINX container for reverse proxy and load balancing
